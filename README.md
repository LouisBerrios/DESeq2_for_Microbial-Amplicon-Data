# DESeq2_for_Microbial-Amplicon-Data

This pipeline will allow you to analyze your amplicon data (in this case bacterial communities) using the `DESeq2 R package`. It assumes that OTU/ASV tables have been generated and merged with sample/meta data. Likewise, the pipeline assumes that a `phyloseq object` has been generated â€“ which we will need to convert into a `DESeq object`.
